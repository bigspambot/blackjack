# blackjack
 
This is my Blackjack game made following a Scrimba tutorial.

I added some extra features like the ability to TWIST and STICK. You can also enter your name at the beginning.

At the moment it treats an Ace (represented by the number 1) as an 11 always. In Blackjack, it can be either a 1 or 11 depending on your needs.

My game also treats any occurance of 21 as Blackjack, but in future I may alter that.

I'd love to add sounds and maybe pictures of the cards.

There are many other possibilities such as the ability to place higher/lower bets, splitting hands, etc, but I just don't have time! ;)

Thanks for reading!
